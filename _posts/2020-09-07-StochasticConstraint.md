**Abstract:** Despite the significant progress made in scheduling in the
past years, industrial problems with several hundred tasks remain intractable
for some variants of the scheduling problems. We present techniques
that can be used to leverage the power of constraint programming
to solve an industrial problem with 800 non-preemptive tasks, 90
resources, and sequence-dependent setup times. Our method involves
solving the traveling salesperson problem (TSP) as a simplification of
the scheduling problem and using the simplified solution to guide the
branching heuristics. We also explore large neighborhood search. Experiments
conducted on a dataset provided by our partner from the textile
industry show that we obtain non-optimal but satisfactory solutions.
